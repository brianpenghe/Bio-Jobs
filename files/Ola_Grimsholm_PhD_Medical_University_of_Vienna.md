Dear colleagues,

We have a PhD student position available in my lab which aims to
investigate allergen-specific memory B cells during allergen-specific
immunotherapy (funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF)).

I would be very grateful if you please would be so kind to share the job
description within your network and/or bring it to the attention of
talented students that are interested in doing a PhD in the vibrant city
of Vienna?

All the best,
Ola
